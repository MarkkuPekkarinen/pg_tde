# What is Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)

Transparent Data Encryption offers encryption at the file level and solves the problem of protecting data at rest. The encryption is completely transparent for users allowing them to access and manipulate the data and not to worry about the encryption process.

## Why do you need TDE?

Using TDE has the following benefits:

* For organizations:
   
   - Ensure data safety when at rest and in motion
   - Comply with security standards like HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOC 2, ISO 27001

* For DBAs:
   
   - Allows defining what to encrypt in the table and with what key
   - Encryption on storage level is not a must to provide data safety. However, using TDE and storage-level encryption together adds another layer of data security
